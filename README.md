Welcome to the UwULang beta program. This is a precursor to my summer project, but it applies the same principles as my summer project. 
A basic summary for this program would be an owo convertor. What I mean by this is that it can take a string and then return the same 
string but this time with the owo modifications added in. 

There are two files because one of them is a standalone python program and the other one is a webpage that you could use. It is still in 
its preliminary stages and there will be much more added to this webpage. If you have any questions, please contact the e-mail listed in 
my account.

Thank you and enjoy the program!
